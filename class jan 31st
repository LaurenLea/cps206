  ### ArrayList

* an array list can grow infinitaly,
takes up one spot in stack, and resides in the heap

* have to import java.util.*;

in the heap there are nodes
, nodes have next and data, doesnt know data type

### upper bounds and lower bounds

* <E extends shape lets anything make shape grow

* <E extends Comparable(?super E), E==String

.toString() just returns address, not so with ArrayList

find out why array is 0 based over 1 based
